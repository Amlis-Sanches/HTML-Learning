Learning HTML in VS Code is a great choice! Here's how to get started:

### 1. **Install VS Code**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from [VS Code Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. **Set Up Your Workspace**
   - Create a new folder where you will store your HTML files.
   - Open VS Code and go to `File > Open Folder` to open the folder.

### 3. **Install Useful Extensions**
   - Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
   - Search for and install the following extensions:
     - **HTML Snippets**: Provides helpful HTML code snippets.
     - **Live Server**: Allows you to preview your HTML in a browser and see live updates.

### 4. **Create Your First HTML File**
   - In your workspace, right-click and select `New File`.
   - Name the file `index.html`.
   - Open the file and add the following basic HTML structure:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>My First HTML Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
         <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

### 5. **Preview Your HTML File**
   - Right-click inside the `index.html` file and choose "Open with Live Server."
   - If you installed Live Server, your default web browser will open with your HTML page. Changes you make in VS Code will automatically reflect in the browser.

### 6. **Learn the Basics of HTML**
   - **Tags**: Learn common HTML tags like `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, `<img>` for images, and `<div>` for divisions.
   - **Attributes**: Learn how to use attributes like `href` for links and `src` for images.
   - **Structure**: Understand the basic structure of an HTML document with `<head>` and `<body>`.

### 7. **Resources to Learn HTML**
   - [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML): Comprehensive and beginner-friendly.
   - [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/): Offers an interactive environment to test code.
