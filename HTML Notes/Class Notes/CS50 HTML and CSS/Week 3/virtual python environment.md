# Creating a virtual python environment
You are able to create an extension python with a virtual environment to use for your programming needs. To create a virtual environment:
1. **Open The Desired Directory:** Using the `cd` command in #CMD navigate to the desired folder you want to create your environment.
	> [!info]
	> You can auto navigate to the folder you want by opening the folder you want to create the environment in, remove the path and type cmd in the path directory. This will open cmd at that location
	
2. **Create the Virtual Environment:** Create the environment in #CMD with `python -m venv my_venv`. Then wait
3. **Activate the environment:** Activate the environment by using the activate module by typing the path `my_venv\Scripts\activate`
4. **Install Packages:** install your desired packages while inside the environment `pip install Django`
5. **Create Django environment:** create an environment by opening to the correct directory and then creating a project with `django-admin startproject lecture3`.
